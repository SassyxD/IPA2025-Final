2025-10-25

- Action: Read repository documentation and main implementation files.
	Files read: IPA2025.md, README.md, ipa2024_final.py, restconf_final.py, netconf_final.py, netmiko_final.py, ansible_final.py, playbook.yaml, hosts, ansible.cfg
	Notes: IPA2025 adds requirements on selecting method (restconf/netconf), specifying target router IP (10.0.15.61-65), ansible-based showrun that writes a file show_run_[STUDENT_ID]_[router].txt, and additional commands (motd, gigabit_status).

- Action: Created initial todo list and plan (tracked separately with the todo tool).

- Next: Implement Part 1 changes (dispatcher parsing in `ipa2024_final.py` to support method and IP selection, and stronger error messages). Will commit each code change with conventional commit messages and append progress here.
