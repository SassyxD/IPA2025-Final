2025-10-25

- Action: Read repository documentation and main implementation files.
	Files read: IPA2025.md, README.md, ipa2024_final.py, restconf_final.py, netconf_final.py, netmiko_final.py, ansible_final.py, playbook.yaml, hosts, ansible.cfg
	Notes: IPA2025 adds requirements on selecting method (restconf/netconf), specifying target router IP (10.0.15.61-65), ansible-based showrun that writes a file show_run_[STUDENT_ID]_[router].txt, and additional commands (motd, gigabit_status).

- Action: Created initial todo list and plan (tracked separately with the todo tool).

- Next: Implement Part 1 changes (dispatcher parsing in `ipa2024_final.py` to support method and IP selection, and stronger error messages). Will commit each code change with conventional commit messages and append progress here.

- 2025-10-25  -- Implemented dynamic method selection + router IP handling
	- Files changed: `ipa2024_final.py`, `restconf_final.py`, `netconf_final.py`
	- Summary: Added a small persistent state (state.json) to remember whether the student chose Restconf or Netconf via messages like `/66070123 restconf`. Updated dispatcher parsing to accept messages with optional router IP (10.0.15.61-65) and commands. Modified RESTCONF and NETCONF modules so router IP can be passed at runtime.
	- Notes / problems: Needed to change netconf module to create a fresh manager per call (ncclient). This will require ncclient and xmltodict available in the environment to actually connect; locally those modules are not present in this workspace and will show lint/import errors until dependencies are installed in the runtime environment.
	- Next: Implement Part 2 tasks (ansible motd, showrun improvements, and netmiko motd support). Will commit each subsequent change and log it here.
