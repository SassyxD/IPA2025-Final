- Action: Read repository documentation and main implementation files.
	Files read: IPA2025.md, README.md, ipa2024_final.py, restconf_final.py, netconf_final.py, netmiko_final.py, ansible_final.py, playbook.yaml, hosts, ansible.cfg
	Notes: IPA2025 adds requirements on selecting method (restconf/netconf), specifying target router IP (10.0.15.61-65), ansible-based showrun that writes a file show_run_[STUDENT_ID]_[router].txt, and additional commands (motd, gigabit_status).

- Action: Created initial todo list and plan (tracked separately with the todo tool).

- Next: Implement Part 1 changes (dispatcher parsing in `ipa2024_final.py` to support method and IP selection, and stronger error messages). Will commit each code change with conventional commit messages and append progress here.

- 2025-10-25  -- Implemented dynamic method selection + router IP handling
	- Files changed: `ipa2024_final.py`, `restconf_final.py`, `netconf_final.py`
	- Summary: Added a small persistent state (state.json) to remember whether the student chose Restconf or Netconf via messages like `/66070123 restconf`. Updated dispatcher parsing to accept messages with optional router IP (10.0.15.61-65) and commands. Modified RESTCONF and NETCONF modules so router IP can be passed at runtime.
	- Notes / problems: Needed to change netconf module to create a fresh manager per call (ncclient). This will require ncclient and xmltodict available in the environment to actually connect; locally those modules are not present in this workspace and will show lint/import errors until dependencies are installed in the runtime environment.
	- Next: Implement Part 2 tasks (ansible motd, showrun improvements, and netmiko motd support). Will commit each subsequent change and log it here.

	- 2025-10-25  -- Implemented MOTD set/read and added playbook
		- Files changed/added: `playbook_motd.yaml`, `ansible_final.py`, `netmiko_final.py`, `ipa2024_final.py`
		- Summary: Added `playbook_motd.yaml` to configure MOTD via Ansible. Added `ansible_final.motd()` to run that playbook with an MOTD environment variable. Added `netmiko_final.read_motd()` to read the configured MOTD via Netmiko. Updated dispatcher to parse and handle `/studentID IP motd <message>` (set) and `/studentID IP motd` (read).
		- Notes: Ansible playbooks require `cisco.ios` collection and `ansible-playbook` present. Netmiko and ncclient libraries are required for the dynamic NETCONF/Netmiko features.
		- Next: Implement tests or small smoke checks, then finalize and prepare the report.

- 2025-10-25  -- Smoke checks
  - Action: Ran `python3 -m compileall` to check for syntax errors in repository Python files.
  - Result: PYTHON COMPILE: OK
  - Notes: Some import-time lint messages remain in the editor for missing external libraries (netmiko, ncclient, xmltodict, requests_toolbelt). These are expected until the runtime environment has the required packages installed.

- 2025-10-25  -- Python virtual environment setup
  - Action: Created Python virtual environment (.venv) and installed all dependencies from requirements.txt
  - Commands used:
    - `python3 -m venv .venv`
    - `source .venv/bin/activate && pip install --upgrade pip`
    - `source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - `source .venv/bin/activate && ansible-galaxy collection install cisco.ios`
  - Result: Successfully installed all required packages (requests, ncclient, netmiko, xmltodict, ansible, etc.) and cisco.ios Ansible collection
  - Files changed: Updated .gitignore to exclude .venv/, __pycache__/, state.json, and show_run_*.txt files from git
  - Notes: Virtual environment is now ready for testing. All import errors should be resolved when running Python scripts with the activated venv.

- 2025-10-25  -- Created Webex usage documentation
  - Files added: WEBEX_USAGE.md
  - Summary: Created comprehensive guide for using the bot with Webex Teams, including:
    - Prerequisites and environment setup
    - All supported commands with examples
    - Method selection (restconf/netconf) workflow
    - Router IP specification (10.0.15.61-65)
    - Loopback interface operations (create/delete/enable/disable/status)
    - MOTD configuration (set via Ansible, read via Netmiko)
    - GigabitEthernet status check (via Netmiko/TextFSM)
    - Show running config (via Ansible playbook)
    - Error messages reference
    - Example workflow and troubleshooting tips
  - Notes: Document ready for students to test bot functionality in IPA2025 lab room.

## Summary of All Changes for IPA2025

### Implementation Overview:
1. **Part 1 - Dynamic Method & Router Selection**: 
   - Added persistent state file (state.json) to remember method selection (restconf/netconf)
   - Implemented parser to extract method, IP, and command from Webex messages
   - Modified restconf_final.py and netconf_final.py to accept router_ip parameter
   - Added validation for allowed router IPs (10.0.15.61-65)
   - Added clear error messages as per requirements

2. **Part 2 - MOTD & Enhanced Commands**:
   - Created playbook_motd.yaml for Ansible-based MOTD configuration
   - Added ansible_final.motd() function to run MOTD playbook with environment variable
   - Added netmiko_final.read_motd() to retrieve configured MOTD via Netmiko
   - Enhanced dispatcher to handle MOTD set (with message) and read (without message)
   - Existing gigabit_status and showrun already implemented, updated to use dynamic IPs

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - Set up Python virtual environment with all dependencies
   - Created comprehensive .gitignore
   - Created WEBEX_USAGE.md documentation

### Files Created/Modified:
**Created:**
- playbook_motd.yaml (Ansible MOTD configuration)
- WEBEX_USAGE.md (User guide)
- .gitignore (Git ignore patterns)
- state.json (will be created at runtime for method persistence)

**Modified:**
- ipa2024_final.py (dispatcher with method/IP parsing and validation)
- restconf_final.py (dynamic router_ip support)
- netconf_final.py (per-call manager creation with router_ip)

4. Test with commands from WEBEX_USAGE.md

- 2025-10-25  -- Pushed to GitHub
  - Action: Successfully pushed all 7 commits to GitHub repository
  - Repository: https://github.com/SassyxD/IPA2025-Final
  - Commits pushed: 7 commits (from docs(log) to docs: add comprehensive Webex usage guide)
  - Notes: All changes are now available on GitHub. Repository includes complete implementation of IPA2025 requirements with proper conventional commits and documentation.

- 2025-10-25  -- Testing with Webex and bug fix
  - Action: Set up Webex bot and tested with IPA2025 room
  - Room ID: Y2lzY29zcGFyazovL3VybjpURUFNOnVzLXdlc3QtMl9yL1JPT00vYmQwODczMTAtNmMyNi0xMWYwLWE1MWMtNzkzZDM2ZjZjM2Zm
  - Student ID: 66070061
  - Problem encountered: NameError - variable 'command' was not defined in the outer scope when checking for showrun file attachment
  - Solution: Added initialization of 'command = None' and 'ip = None' at the beginning of the message parsing block (before the if-else branches)
  - Files changed: ipa2024_final.py, list.py
  - Test result: Successfully received "/66070061 restconf" command and set method to Restconf
  - Notes: Bug was in variable scoping - command was defined inside else block but referenced outside. Fixed by initializing at top level.

- 2025-10-25  -- Multiple bug fixes after live testing
  - Action: Tested bot with real Webex room and identified several issues
  - Problems found:
    1. Response messages didn't include method name (Restconf/Netconf) as required by spec
    2. Ansible MOTD playbook had "delegate_to: localhost" causing "Connection type local is not valid" error
    3. Error message "Error: No command found." not showing correctly
  - Solutions applied:
    1. Updated all response messages in restconf_final.py to include "using Restconf" and "(checked by Restconf)"
    2. Updated all response messages in netconf_final.py to include "using Netconf" and "(checked by Netconf)"
    3. Removed "delegate_to: localhost" from playbook_motd.yaml - Ansible should run on router directly
    4. Improved error message logic in ipa2024_final.py to properly show "Error: No command found."
  - Files changed: restconf_final.py, netconf_final.py, playbook_motd.yaml, ipa2024_final.py
  - Test results: 
    - "/66070061 10.0.15.61 create" → "Interface loopback 66070061 is created successfully using Restconf" ✓
    - "/66070061 10.0.15.61 status" → "Interface loopback 66070061 is enabled (checked by Restconf)" ✓
    - Invalid IP error messages working correctly ✓
  - Notes: All messages now conform to IPA2025 spec examples. MOTD playbook should work after removing delegate_to.
